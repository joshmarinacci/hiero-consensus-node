# GitHub Action Naming Standards

This document outlines the conventions and best practices for naming GitHub workflow files,
organizing workflow directories, and structuring workflow definitions.
It is intended to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across all repository workflows.

## Workflow Naming Standards:

### Workflow Name

`ddd: [XXXX] <my-21-char-name>`

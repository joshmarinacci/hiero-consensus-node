# Consensus Layer Knowledge Base

`consensus-state` is part of the **consensus layer** — consensus-side state structures shared
at the boundary with the execution layer. When working here, consult the consensus-layer
knowledge base at [`../docs/consensus-layer/`](../docs/consensus-layer/) — it documents the
current implementation as canonical, anchored to specific files, classes, and methods.

**Most relevant to this module:**

- [`architecture/topics/signed-state-management.md`](../docs/consensus-layer/architecture/topics/signed-state-management.md) — round signing, state hashing, signature collection.
- [`architecture/interfaces/consensus-execution-boundary.md`](../docs/consensus-layer/architecture/interfaces/consensus-execution-boundary.md) — how state structures are shared across the boundary. Note: the proposed design moves state under the execution layer; this module sits on the consensus side today.

**Navigation.** Start at [`architecture/overview.md`](../docs/consensus-layer/architecture/overview.md).

# Reconnect

## Responsibilities

Reconnect is the recovery path for a node that has fallen so far behind
that gossip alone cannot catch it up. It owns three things: detecting
that the node is behind, transferring a signed state from a healthy
peer (the learner / teacher exchange), and re-anchoring local
components so that event intake, hashgraph, and event creation can
resume from the new round.

It does not own:

- the gossip protocol stack itself — see [`gossip.md`](gossip.md), where
  the reconnect protocol is one of three protocols on the shared
  connection;
- ISS recovery or PCES replay across restart — see
  [`restart-and-pces.md`](restart-and-pces.md);
- signed-state internals (round signing, state hashing, signature
  collection) — see
  [`signed-state-management.md`](signed-state-management.md).

## Lifecycle

The orchestration entry point is the `ReconnectModule` interface in
[`swirlds-platform-core`](../../../../swirlds-platform-core/src/main/java/com/swirlds/platform/reconnect/ReconnectModule.java),
implemented by
[`DefaultReconnectModule`](../../../../consensus-reconnect-impl/src/main/java/org/hiero/consensus/reconnect/impl/DefaultReconnectModule.java)
in `consensus-reconnect-impl`. `DefaultReconnectModule.initialize`
constructs a `ReconnectController` and starts it on a dedicated
thread.

The module organisation is deliberately unusual. Reconnect's
functionality does not really belong in the consensus layer, and
the implementation depends on packages that violate the layer's
usual dependency restrictions. Keeping reconnect in a dedicated
`consensus-reconnect-impl` module is a pragmatic compromise: it
isolates the exception so those constraint-breaking dependencies
do not leak into regular consensus-layer code, pending the move
of reconnect to Execution (see [Future state](#future-state)).

[`ReconnectController`](../../../../consensus-reconnect-impl/src/main/java/org/hiero/consensus/reconnect/impl/ReconnectController.java)
runs a continuous loop: it blocks until the node detects it has fallen
behind, then attempts a reconnect, retrying until success or until
configured thresholds are exceeded. Each attempt walks five phases.

1. **Detection.** `ReconnectController` blocks on
   `FallenBehindMonitor.awaitFallenBehind()`. The monitor flips its
   `isBehind` flag once enough peers have reported the local node as
   behind. See [Detection](#detection-fallenbehindmonitor).
2. **Peer selection and handshake.** Teacher selection is random:
   the learner offers the reconnect protocol to peers, and the
   first peer whose `ReconnectStatePeerProtocol.shouldAccept()`
   returns true becomes the teacher. There is no explicit ranking
   step inside `ReconnectController`. A peer accepts the role only
   if **all** of the following hold:
   - it is not itself behind
     (`FallenBehindMonitor.hasFallenBehind()` is false);
   - its platform status is `ACTIVE`;
   - it holds a fully-signed signed state — `lastCompleteSignedState`
     is non-null and `isComplete()`;
   - it is not currently acting as a learner (the
     `BlockingResourceProvider<ReservedSignedStateResult>` learner
     permit can be acquired);
   - `ReconnectStateTeacherThrottle` permits another teacher
     session, which bounds the node to one learner at a time.

   State retrieval is asynchronous: the controller waits on the
   same `BlockingResourceProvider<ReservedSignedStateResult>` for
   the next available state.

3. **State transfer.** The receiving side runs
   `ReconnectStateLearner.execute()`; the sending side runs
   `ReconnectStateTeacher.execute()`. See
   [Learner / teacher protocol](#learner--teacher-protocol).

4. **Validation and load.** The default `SignedStateValidator`
   checks only that the received state carries a signature quorum.
   No roster compatibility or software version check is performed,
   and the chain of reasoning is: nodes do not establish connections
   with peers on a different software version, and the roster can
   only change at a version-upgrade boundary — so the state a node
   learns will always carry the same roster it already knew about.
   Reconnect across an upgrade is not yet supported.
   `ReconnectCoordinator.loadReconnectState` then re-initialises
   every component that depends on an event window (hashgraph,
   event intake, shadowgraph, …) against the new state. See
   [Post-reconnect resumption](#post-reconnect-resumption).

5. **Resumption.** `ReconnectController` submits a
   `ReconnectCompleteAction`; the status machine moves the node to
   `RECONNECT_COMPLETE`, then to `CHECKING` once the state is
   persisted to disk, and the loop returns to phase 1.

If an attempt fails, the controller backs off and re-enters detection;
once the count crosses
`ReconnectConfig.maximumReconnectFailuresBeforeShutdown` the node
exits via `SystemExitUtils` with `SystemExitCode.RECONNECT_FAILURE`.

## Detection (`FallenBehindMonitor`)

[`FallenBehindMonitor`](../../../../consensus-utility/src/main/java/org/hiero/consensus/monitoring/FallenBehindMonitor.java)
collects fallen-behind reports from peers — each peer that observes
the local node lagging on event-window boundaries calls
`FallenBehindMonitor.report(NodeId)`. The monitor recomputes whether
the node is behind on every report and signals waiting threads when
the state flips to behind.

The trigger condition is in `FallenBehindMonitor.checkAndNotify()`:

```java
isBehind = peersSize * fallenBehindThreshold < reportFallenBehind.size()
        || (peersSize > 0 && reportFallenBehind.size() == peersSize);
```

`fallenBehindThreshold` is a proportion (0.0–1.0) read from
`FallenBehindConfig.fallenBehindThreshold`; the second clause covers
the edge case where every peer has reported. See
[`../../tunables.md`](../../tunables.md) for the configured value. The
monitor also surfaces two metrics under the `internal` category:
`hasFallenBehind` and `numReportFallenBehind`.

Detection is only the trigger; before the learner can fetch a new
state the node has to stop gossiping, stop creating events, and clear its pipeline. `notifySyncProtocolPaused()` /
`awaitGossipPaused()` on `FallenBehindMonitor` are the gossip-pause
handshake used for that preparation: once the monitor flips to
behind, gossip is stopped, in-flight tasks are flushed, and data
structures that depend on the current event window are cleared.
Only after that preparation completes does the learner request a new
state from a teacher.

## Learner / teacher protocol

State transfer is a paired exchange. The node that has fallen behind
acts as **learner**; a healthy peer acts as **teacher**. Both sides
reuse the shared connection that gossip already maintains; the
reconnect protocol is one of three protocols multiplexed on that
connection (see [`gossip.md`](gossip.md) for the protocol-stack view).

- [`ReconnectStateLearner`](../../../../consensus-reconnect-impl/src/main/java/org/hiero/consensus/reconnect/impl/ReconnectStateLearner.java)
  drives the learner side. `execute()` performs the actual state sync
  and returns a reserved signed state.

- [`ReconnectStateTeacher`](../../../../consensus-reconnect-impl/src/main/java/org/hiero/consensus/reconnect/impl/ReconnectStateTeacher.java)
  drives the teacher side. `execute()` streams the local signed state
  to the requesting peer.

- [`ReconnectStateTeacherThrottle`](../../../../consensus-reconnect-impl/src/main/java/org/hiero/consensus/reconnect/impl/ReconnectStateTeacherThrottle.java)
  bounds how often this node accepts a teacher session.
  `initiateReconnect()` is the gate; `reconnectAttemptFinished()`
  releases the slot; `getNumberOfRecentReconnects()` exposes the
  observed rate.

- [`ReconnectStateSyncProtocol`](../../../../consensus-reconnect-impl/src/main/java/org/hiero/consensus/reconnect/impl/ReconnectStateSyncProtocol.java)
  is the gossip-side protocol object — it produces a per-peer
  `ReconnectStatePeerProtocol` instance via `createPeerInstance()` and
  tracks the platform status the per-peer decisions depend on
  (`updatePlatformStatus()`). The "sync" in the name refers to state
  synchronisation; the gossip event-exchange algorithm is a separate
  protocol described in [`gossip.md`](gossip.md).

- [`ReconnectStatePeerProtocol`](../../../../consensus-reconnect-impl/src/main/java/org/hiero/consensus/reconnect/impl/ReconnectStatePeerProtocol.java)
  is the per-connection implementation: `shouldInitiate()` decides
  whether to start a reconnect attempt as learner, `shouldAccept()`
  whether to accept one as teacher, and `runProtocol()` runs the
  chosen role on the active connection.

The learner-side `shouldInitiate()` has no gates beyond
`FallenBehindMonitor` reporting the local node behind by this peer.
The teacher-side conditions are listed in
[Lifecycle](#lifecycle) step 2.

## Post-reconnect resumption

Once a state is validated, the entire set of components that depend
on an event window has to be re-initialised against it — the
hashgraph algorithm, event intake, the shadowgraph, and any other
component carrying round / event-window state. These structures
were already cleared during preparation (see
[Detection](#detection-fallenbehindmonitor)); resumption is the
mirror step that pushes the new state into them.

The orchestration lives in
[`ReconnectCoordinator.loadReconnectState`](../../../../consensus-reconnect-impl/src/main/java/org/hiero/consensus/reconnect/impl/ReconnectCoordinator.java);
see that method for the exact set of overrides and injections it
performs.

Status transitions follow loading in two stages.
`ReconnectController` submits a `ReconnectCompleteAction` once a
valid state has been learned, and the platform status machine moves
the node to `RECONNECT_COMPLETE`. The node only advances from
`RECONNECT_COMPLETE` to `CHECKING` — the status at which it is
permitted to create events — after the state has been written to
disk.

The event window — which carries the ancient round and the other
round thresholds — is what tells event-intake which events to keep
and which to discard; updating it during `loadReconnectState` is how
the discard rule re-anchors. See
[`event-intake.md`](event-intake.md) for the window's full role.

The event creator does not run separate logic for event creation after a reconnect; the
status machine is the gate. After `RECONNECT_COMPLETE` the node
moves to `CHECKING`, where it may create events. It re-enters
`ACTIVE` as soon as one of those events reaches consensus in a
timely manner (a transition through `OBSERVING` would also be
valid). Note that if the Execution layer keeps its transaction
pool across the reconnect, the node may briefly create events
carrying user transactions that have already gone stale.

There is no separate "caught-up" signal: reaching `ACTIVE` *is* the
recovered state — the node is back to creating events that reach
consensus.

## Failure behavior

A reconnect attempt that is interrupted — broken connection,
unexpected exception, validation failure — is not resumed. The
controller drops any partial progress and starts the next attempt
from scratch, beginning with teacher selection. The
`ReconnectConfig.maximumReconnectFailuresBeforeShutdown` cap noted
in [Lifecycle](#lifecycle) counts these attempts.

A reconnect that completes successfully but leaves the node still
behind is not a special case. Detection runs the same way it did
originally: peers report the node as behind on event-window
boundaries, `FallenBehindMonitor` flips, and another reconnect
begins. The follow-up attempt transfers less data than the first,
because the state delta from the just-loaded state is smaller than
the original gap.

This gives reconnect a natural catch-up property. A node that
cannot close the entire backlog in one attempt can chain reconnects
and converge to live, provided each learned state represents more
forward progress than the `ACTIVE` network has applied to the live
state in the meantime. If the live state advances faster than each
reconnect can close the gap, the failure cap eventually trips and
the node exits.

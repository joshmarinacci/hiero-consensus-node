# Decisions

Per-file ADRs. Each ADR records context, decision, alternatives considered, and consequences. Standard ADR pattern. This README is the chronological index.

## Naming convention

`ADR-NNN-short-slug.md`, where `NNN` is zero-padded to three digits (e.g., `ADR-007-replace-stale-events-detection.md`). Cross-references from other files use the ID only (e.g., "See ADR-007").

| [ADR-001](ADR-001-pces-state-snapshot-coordination.md)   | No Coordination Between PCES Writer and Signed State Writer for Snapshot PCES Copy           | 2026-05-08 | Accepted | The signed state writer copies PCES files into the snapshot directory on a best-effort basis after the merkle state is written, accepting occasional copy failures rather than coordinating with the PCES writer.                                                                                            |
| [ADR-002](ADR-002-execution-freeze-signature-handoff.md) | Block `onSealConsensusRound` to Hand Off Freeze Block Signatures from Execution to Consensus | 2026-05-12 | Accepted | The execution layer blocks the return of `onSealConsensusRound` at freeze time until its freeze-block signature transaction is in the pool and a threshold of freeze-block signatures has been collected, bounded by a maximum timeout. Temporary; to be removed once blocks are signed with TSS signatures. |

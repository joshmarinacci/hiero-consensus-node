# Decisions — Index

Architecturally significant decisions about the consensus layer, recorded as ADRs
of the form **context → decision → consequences**.

This is the catalog of choices the team has deliberately made and wants future
readers to understand without re-deriving the reasoning. Entries are
independent and self-contained: one decision per entry. ADRs are linked to each
other by ID (e.g., a `Superseded by` pointer in the body), not nested.

- Entry format: see `FORMAT.md`.

Entries are born `Proposed` and become `Accepted` once the deciders have signed
off. `Superseded` marks a decision replaced by a later ADR (name the successor
in the body); `Deprecated` marks one that no longer applies because the
underlying code or design has changed but no replacement decision exists. Treat
`Status` as load-bearing — keep the row here and the body's `## Status` in sync.

| [ADR-001](ADR-001-pces-state-snapshot-coordination.md)   | No Coordination Between PCES Writer and Signed State Writer for Snapshot PCES Copy           | 2026-05-08 | Accepted | The signed state writer copies PCES files into the snapshot directory on a best-effort basis after the merkle state is written, accepting occasional copy failures rather than coordinating with the PCES writer.                                                                                            |
| [ADR-002](ADR-002-execution-freeze-signature-handoff.md) | Block `onSealConsensusRound` to Hand Off Freeze Block Signatures from Execution to Consensus | 2026-05-12 | Accepted | The execution layer blocks the return of `onSealConsensusRound` at freeze time until its freeze-block signature transaction is in the pool and a threshold of freeze-block signatures has been collected, bounded by a maximum timeout. Temporary; to be removed once blocks are signed with TSS signatures. |

Row convention, one line per entry, kept in ADR-NNN order:
| [ADR-NNN](ADR-NNN-short-slug.md) | Title from entry's `# ADR:` heading | YYYY-MM-DD | Proposed|Accepted|Superseded|Deprecated | One or two sentences capturing what was decided and why. |

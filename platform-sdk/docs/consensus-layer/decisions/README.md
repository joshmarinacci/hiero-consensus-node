# Decisions — Index

Architecturally significant decisions about the consensus layer, recorded as ADRs
of the form **context → decision → consequences**.

This is the catalog of choices the team has deliberately made and wants future
readers to understand without re-deriving the reasoning. Entries are
independent and self-contained: one decision per entry. ADRs are linked to
each other via the `related.decisions` field in frontmatter (e.g., a successor
named under `related.decisions` for a `superseded` entry), not nested.

- Entry format: see `FORMAT.md`.
- Allowed `topics` values: see top-level `topics.md` (when established).

Entries are born `proposed` and become `accepted` once the deciders have
signed off. `superseded` marks a decision replaced by a later ADR (name the
successor under `related.decisions`); `deprecated` marks one that no longer
applies because the underlying code or design has changed but no replacement
decision exists. Treat `status` as load-bearing — keep the row here and the
frontmatter `status:` in sync.

| [ADR-001](ADR-001-pces-state-snapshot-coordination.md)   | No Coordination Between PCES Writer and Signed State Writer for Snapshot PCES Copy           | signed-state, pces                            | 2026-05-08 | accepted | The signed state writer copies PCES files into the snapshot directory on a best-effort basis after the merkle state is written, accepting occasional copy failures rather than coordinating with the PCES writer.                                                                                            |

Temporary; to be removed once blocks are signed with TSS signatures. |

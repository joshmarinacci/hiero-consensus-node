# Decisions — Index

Architecturally significant decisions about the consensus layer, recorded as ADRs
of the form **context → decision → consequences**.

This is the catalog of choices the team has deliberately made and wants future
readers to understand without re-deriving the reasoning. Entries are
independent and self-contained: one decision per entry. ADRs are linked to
each other via the `related.decisions` field in frontmatter (e.g., a successor
named under `related.decisions` for a `superseded` entry), not nested.

- Entry format: see `FORMAT.md`.
- Allowed `topics` values: see top-level `topics.md` (when established).

Entries are born `proposed` and become `accepted` once the deciders have
signed off. `superseded` marks a decision replaced by a later ADR (name the
successor under `related.decisions`); `deprecated` marks one that no longer
applies because the underlying code or design has changed but no replacement
decision exists. Treat `status` as load-bearing — keep the row here and the
frontmatter `status:` in sync.

| [ADR-001](ADR-001-pces-state-snapshot-coordination.md)                | No Coordination Between PCES Writer and Signed State Writer for Snapshot PCES Copy                        | 2026-05-08 | Accepted | The signed state writer copies PCES files into the snapshot directory on a best-effort basis after the merkle state is written, accepting occasional copy failures rather than coordinating with the PCES writer.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [ADR-002](ADR-002-execution-freeze-signature-handoff.md)              | Block `onSealConsensusRound` to Hand Off Freeze Block Signatures from Execution to Consensus              | 2026-05-12 | Accepted | The execution layer blocks the return of `onSealConsensusRound` at freeze time until its freeze-block signature transaction is in the pool and a threshold of freeze-block signatures has been collected, bounded by a maximum timeout. Temporary; to be removed once blocks are signed with TSS signatures.                                                                                      |
| [ADR-003](ADR-003-remove-pces-recovery-method.md)                     | Remove `SwirldsPlatform.performPcesRecovery()` and Drive ISS Recovery On the Spot                         | 2026-05-19 | Accepted | The platform no longer carries a built-in offline ISS-recovery entry point. When recovery is needed, a one-off driver is written against the platform of the day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [ADR-004](ADR-004-retain-observing-status-for-self-event-recovery.md) | Retain the OBSERVING Platform Status for Self-Event Recovery After Disk Loss                              | 2026-06-02 | Accepted | PCES now guarantees that all gossiped events are on disk after shutdown, making OBSERVING redundant for ordinary crashes. The status is kept anyway as the only recovery path for a node that returns with a corrupted or wiped disk, where gossip is the sole way to relearn its latest self event and avoid branching.                                                                          |
| [ADR-005](ADR-005-embedded-future-event-buffers.md)                   | Embed a future-event buffer inside each consuming component instead of one standalone buffering component | 2026-06-03 | Accepted | Each of `DefaultConsensusEngine` and `DefaultEventCreationManager` owns a private `FutureEventBuffer` rather than sharing one standalone upstream component. This avoids a consensus-advance → event-window-advance → release-more-events feedback loop in the pipeline, keeping `flushIntakePipeline()` a single ordered pass and protecting the no-branching guarantee (RUL-002).               |
| [ADR-006](ADR-006-coordinated-network-wide-upgrade.md)                | Upgrade Software via a Coordinated Network-Wide Freeze Rather Than Rolling Upgrades                       | 2026-06-04 | Accepted | Because two software versions can deterministically produce different state and blocks from the same input, the network upgrades through a coordinated network-wide freeze with a single agreed boundary between the last block of the old version and the first of the new, rather than rolling upgrades. Downtime is accepted today; a future side-by-side handover stays in the same category. |
